In the event of a tragedy, life insurance proceeds can help cover everyday 
expenses, like the mortgage and household bills. The cash received from a 
policy (the death benefit) can help protect your family from being burdened 
with debt. In addition to helping meet your family's immediate financial 
needs, life insurance can also be used to help keep a business thriving, 
help finance future needs like your children's education or supplement your 
retirement funds.
 
You may know the distinct pride you get in purchasing your own home or car. 
Ownership can give a certain comfort, a certain satisfaction that your 
financial stability is solid, secure, and even permanent. Wouldn't you like 
to feel that way about your family's financial future – even if you weren't 
around to provide for them? When you purchase life insurance, you select a 
plan that provides the right kind of protection for your family.
